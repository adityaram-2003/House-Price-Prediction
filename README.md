## Introduction

House prices are influenced by various factors such as location, size, amenities, and market conditions. Predicting house prices accurately can be challenging due to the complexity of these factors. Machine learning models provide a promising approach to forecast house prices based on historical data and relevant features.

This project leverages regularized linear regression to predict house prices. The model is trained on historical house price data and relevant features extracted from various sources. The trained model is then integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to upload datasets and obtain house price predictions.

## Features

- Prediction of house prices using regularized linear regression
- Data pre-processing techniques such as feature extraction and normalization
- Integration with Flask to create a user-friendly web interface
- Visualization of prediction errors and model performance
- Simple and intuitive user experience

## Getting Started

To get started with the House Price Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Flask application.
4. Upload a dataset containing house price data.
5. Obtain predictions for house prices.

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Flask application by executing the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the Flask application is running, you can access it through a web browser. Upload a dataset containing house price data using the provided interface. After uploading the dataset, click on the "Predict Prices" button to obtain predictions for house prices.
